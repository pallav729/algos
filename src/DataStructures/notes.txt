Contiguous vs Linked Data Structures
	- First is sigle contiguous slab of memory.
	- eg. array, matrices, heaps and hash tables
	- Second is distinct chunk of memory, bound together by pointers
Array
	- constant access time for given index
	- space effecient, no pointers
	- memory locality
	- fixed size
List
	- dynamic size
	- O(n) access times
